# Loop State

Canonical tracker: Beads epic `gh-forgejo-shim-6y9`

This file is a compact resume aid only. If this file disagrees with Beads, Beads wins.

Status: in progress

Stream: `chatgpt-forgejo-pr-compatibility`

Execution profile: `adaptive`

Harness: `codex`

Adapter contract: `dirtyloops-harness/1`



Current phase: S6

Current Beads issue: gh-forgejo-shim-c07

Current PR: https://github.com/dirtydishes/gh-forgejo-shim/pull/29

Current execution strategy: direct coordinator TDD for PR discovery, `@me`, and pagination

Last completed phase: S5

Blocked: no — S6 passed its refreshed ownership gates and is reclaimed for TDD

## Decisions

- The current user instruction selects adaptive ownership for this accepted plan.
- Beads owns state and dependencies. Git owns source truth. Review and CI own acceptance.

## Context To Keep

- Accepted plan: `docs/implementation/chatgpt-support/PLAN.md`.
- Starting integration branch and commit at creation: `lavender/chatgpt-support` at `8874d3c7da7ad6c71f32221892853f8f44f91184`.
- S0 must make the two environment-sensitive CLI tests deterministic before later slices.

## Last Coordinator Update

S6 red process commit `466275419cd75d0ac232740d64a870ff6b19784a` is pushed at `0/0` parity before production mutation. The activated build-6720 `@me` test returned `[]` because the old single-request path consumed the `/user` object as a pull list and never resolved the stable login. The next TDD slice establishes the private pull-request source seam, then freezes pagination, terminal-page, limit, and cap behavior in that owned module. The coordinator remains the sole writer and PR #29 remains the sole external integration PR.

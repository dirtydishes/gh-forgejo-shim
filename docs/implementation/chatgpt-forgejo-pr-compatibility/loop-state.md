## Decisions

- The current user instruction selects adaptive ownership for this accepted plan.
- Beads owns state and dependencies. Git owns source truth. Review and CI own acceptance.

## Context To Keep

- Accepted plan: `docs/implementation/chatgpt-support/PLAN.md`.
- Starting integration branch and commit at creation: `lavender/chatgpt-support` at `8874d3c7da7ad6c71f32221892853f8f44f91184`.
- S0 must make the two environment-sensitive CLI tests deterministic before later slices.

## Last Coordinator Update

S5 pass-2 red head `e1dfe16659675a00f4d9e51366ba420b4fca5462` freezes both exact typed-slot escapes. Source repair `543bc7e2cc347d65996128ced5085818b27c1437` derives one capture/deadline decision from `ParsedInvocation`, requires positive PR numbers, excludes help and ambiguous parses, and leaves trace serialization-only. The full locked local gate passes with 219 active tests and 3 planned ignored. Routing is 984 lines, trace 542, and observation 180. Shared repair pass `2/3` now awaits one frozen-head independent review and exact-commit pull-request plus push CI. The coordinator remains the sole writer and PR #29 remains the sole external integration PR.

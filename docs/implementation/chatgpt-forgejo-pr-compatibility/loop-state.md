# Loop State

Canonical tracker: Beads epic `gh-forgejo-shim-6y9`

This file is a compact resume aid only. If this file disagrees with Beads, Beads wins.

Status: pass-7 admission pending

Stream: `chatgpt-forgejo-pr-compatibility`

Execution profile: `adaptive`

Harness: `codex`

Adapter contract: `dirtyloops-harness/1`



Current phase: C1

Current Beads issue: gh-forgejo-shim-c04

Current PR: https://github.com/dirtydishes/gh-forgejo-shim/pull/29

Current execution strategy: direct coordinator repair at the explicit CLI repository-selector validation boundary after fresh pass-7 admission

Last completed phase: S3

Blocked: yes — pass `7/7` is authorized, but C1 remains unclaimed until its refreshed execution and launch readiness gates pass

## Decisions

- The current user instruction selects adaptive ownership for this accepted plan.
- Beads owns state and dependencies. Git owns source truth. Review and CI own acceptance.

## Context To Keep

- Accepted plan: `docs/implementation/chatgpt-support/PLAN.md`.
- Starting integration branch and commit at creation: `lavender/chatgpt-support` at `8874d3c7da7ad6c71f32221892853f8f44f91184`.
- S0 must make the two environment-sensitive CLI tests deterministic before later slices.

## Last Coordinator Update

The user authorized one narrow C1 pass `7/7` after the pass-6 adversarial finding. It owns only explicit CLI repository selectors with leading, trailing, or repeated empty path segments; they must fail closed before provider selection or delegation without changing broader normalization or permissive git-remote parsing. The Beads amendment is canonical and pushed. C1 stays blocked and unclaimed until the coordinator refreshes only its execution-readiness attestation and both exact readiness gates pass. The coordinator remains the sole writer and PR #29 remains the sole external integration PR.

Status: in progress

Current phase: S6

Current Beads issue: gh-forgejo-shim-c07

Current PR: https://github.com/dirtydishes/gh-forgejo-shim/pull/29

Current execution strategy: direct coordinator TDD for PR discovery, `@me`, and pagination

Last completed phase: S5

Blocked: no — S6 passed both readiness gates and is claimed for TDD

## Decisions

- The current user instruction selects adaptive ownership for this accepted plan.
- Beads owns state and dependencies. Git owns source truth. Review and CI own acceptance.

## Context To Keep

- Accepted plan: `docs/implementation/chatgpt-support/PLAN.md`.
- Starting integration branch and commit at creation: `lavender/chatgpt-support` at `8874d3c7da7ad6c71f32221892853f8f44f91184`.
- S0 must make the two environment-sensitive CLI tests deterministic before later slices.

## Last Coordinator Update

S6 exact execution readiness returned `ready` with `findings: []`; live launch readiness returned `boundary_status: ready`, `status: launchable`, and `findings: []`. The checkout, origin, and PR #29 matched `50f62381fb1fa9a9a6d8d739eb56b95512346f65` at clean `0/0` parity. `gh-forgejo-shim-c07` was claimed only after both gates passed and Dolt was pushed. Direct coordinator TDD now owns the coupled identity, pagination, cap, deadline, and output path; one fresh read-only reviewer follows the frozen head. The coordinator remains the sole writer and PR #29 remains the sole external integration PR.

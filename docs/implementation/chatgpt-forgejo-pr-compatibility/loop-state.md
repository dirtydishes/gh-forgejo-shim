Current PR: https://github.com/dirtydishes/gh-forgejo-shim/pull/29

## Decisions

- The current user instruction selects adaptive ownership for this accepted plan.
- Beads owns state and dependencies. Git owns source truth. Review and CI own acceptance.

## Context To Keep

- Accepted plan: `docs/implementation/chatgpt-support/PLAN.md`.
- Starting integration branch and commit at creation: `lavender/chatgpt-support` at `8874d3c7da7ad6c71f32221892853f8f44f91184`.
- S0 must make the two environment-sensitive CLI tests deterministic before later slices.

## Last Coordinator Update

C1 is blocked at exact frozen review head `a0749eab819bf6d0652c0046dc624abd6a4b7a63`. Both required roles returned `changes_requested` at final pass `3/3`: clustered `-R` selectors and selector-shaped consumed payloads can still reverse provider choice; local handler grammar rejects valid attached forms that the routing test counts as safe; and the monolithic CLI process table crossed the required 1,000-line boundary. The full local gate is green, but required review failed and CI admission did not start. No fourth repair or S4 claim is authorized. Beads is canonical and records `gh-forgejo-shim-c04` as blocked; PR #29 remains the sole external integration PR.
